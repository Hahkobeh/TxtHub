Using the Selenium IDE extention for your web browser, open the "TxtHub.side" file. 

Before running these tests with the application active, ensure the base url is correct.

Once the tests are executing, the application will require you to log out between uses. 
  Simply press the "log out" button in the header at the begining of each test case to continue the test. 
  
The "Sign Up" test can only be executed once in the current state, this is because the success of the test creates an account, 
  and any following tests will fail, because there is already an account with the username provided. To re-run this test, edit the 
  value of command 5 to hold a new username.
